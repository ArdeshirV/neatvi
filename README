NEATVI
======

Neatvi is a vi/ex editor.  It can edit bidirectional UTF-8 text.

Edit conf.h to adjust syntax highlighting rules, direction adjustment
patterns, and the alternate keymap.  To define a new keymap, create a
new array in kmap.h, like kmap_fa, and add it to kmaps array in led.c.
When in input mode, ^f switches to the alternate keymap and ^e
switches back to the default keymap.

The following options are supported:

td, textdirection
	Current direction context.  The following values are meaningful:
	
	* +2: always left-to-right.
	* +1: follow conf.h's dircontexts[]; left-to-right for others.
	* -1: follow conf.h's dircontexts[]; right-to-left for others.
	* -2: always right-to-left.

shape
	If set (default), performs Arabic/Farsi letter shaping.

order
	If set, reorder characters based on the rules defined in conf.h.

ai, autoindent
	As in vi(1).

aw, autowrite
	As in vi(1).

ic, ignorecase
	As in vi(1).

hl, highlight
	If set (default), text will receive syntax highlighting based on the
	rules in conf.h.
