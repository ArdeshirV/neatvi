NEATVI
======

Neatvi is a vi/ex editor.  It can edit bidirectional UTF-8 text.

Edit conf.h to adjust syntax highlighting rules and text direction
patterns.  To define a new keymap, create a new array in kmap.h, like
kmap_fa, and add it to kmaps array in the same header (the first entry
of the new array specifies its name).  The current keymap may be
changed using :cm ex command.  When in input mode, ^e changes to the
English kaymap and ^f changes to the alternate keymap (the last keymap
specified with :km).

Commands not available in ex(1):

:cm[ap][!] [kmap]
	Without kmap, print the current keymap name.
	When kmap is specified, set the alternate keymap to
	kmap and, unless ! is given, switch to this keymap.

:ft [filetype]
	Without filetype, print the current file type.
	When filetype is specified, set the file type of the
	current ex buffer.

	meaningful:
